# Learn Code from Us

## Project Introduction

The following text was taken from the about page on [https://learncodefrom.us](https://learncodefrom.us):

> Learn Code from Us is a site that lists people who are members of underrepresented groups in tech who create resources geared towards programmers of all levels. These resources include (but are not limited to) podcasts, blog posts, newsletters, or YouTube videos. For now, this site is geared towards free resources in order to be as accessible as possible

[Here](https://dev.to/aspittel/introducing-learn-code-from-us-oe1) is a blog post with more about the project.

## Adding New People

On the user side, please add a new person through [this form](https://airtable.com/shrYbUMMlR1iVpA1l). 

> This site is specifically for highlighting people who are members of underrepresented groups in tech who create content for programmers.

> Please only submit if you have over five posts, and you are planning on making more content in the future! 

> Also, please only submit your own content at this point!

On the code side, the logic is in `data-formatting/script.js`. It creates the `data.json` file. You need an API key for the base in order to run this script. At this point, Ali will handle this process since it requires a couple manual checks.
