# Learn Code from Us

## Project Introduction

The following text was taken from the about page on [https://learncodefrom.us](https://learncodefrom.us):

> Learn Code from Us is a site that lists people who are members of underrepresented groups in tech who create resources geared towards programmers of all levels. These resources include (but are not limited to) podcasts, blog posts, newsletters, or YouTube videos. For now, this site is geared towards free resources in order to be as accessible as possible

On the code side, the logic is in `data-formatting/script.js`. It creates the `data.json` file. You need an API key for the base in order to run this script. At this point, Ali will handle this process since it requires a couple manual checks.
