# Learn Code from Us
About Us
Learn Code from Us is a site that lists people who are members of underrepresented groups in tech who create resources geared towards programmers of all levels. These resources include (but are not limited to) podcasts, blog posts, newsletters, or YouTube videos. For now, this site is geared towards free resources in order to be as accessible as possible.
