Come and join our next half-day coding bootcamp with lunch provided.\n\nAll of our resources are open source on Github. https://github.com/node-girls-australia","Published":true}},{"id":"recerkEX8sromRy7u","fields":{"Name":"Alex Pliutau","Tags":["WebDev","Go"],"Blog":"https://pliutau.com","YouTube":"https://www.youtube.com/packagemain","Website":"https://pliutau.com","About":"Hi Gophers, my name is Alex Pliutau,\n\nTopics I share:\n - Programming in Go\n - Go code reviews\n - Solving Algorithms with Go\n - Microservices with Go\n - Machine learning in Go\n - Build things with Go","Image":[{"id":"attQ6aA7k4q8M56fn","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/G64Ws34BT46f710auoYg_152ccc4.jpg","filename":"152ccc4.jpg","size":1642756,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/fZN28udJTeKKzql9CfdK_small_152ccc4.jpg","width":36,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/xAongwhWQ22F972JsaBx_large_152ccc4.jpg","width":512,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/FnElpXdiTl2RJogze7oj_full_152ccc4.jpg","width":2224,"height":2224}}}],"Dev":"https://dev.to/plutov","Published":true}}]
